I have used the nix-tts model as my current TTS model in the robot.

1) Setup
git clone https://github.com/rendchevi/nix-tts.git
cd nix-tts
pip install -r requirements.txt (ignore onnxruntime version specified in the file and install the latest)
2) download the onnx files
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1GbFOnJsgKHCAXySm2sTluRRikc4TAWxJ
download the deterministic one as stochastic seems to be not working. Place these files in any location, but make sure to mention the path in verifyTTS.py file.
I have pasted the files in nix/models

3) Change code
I have changed some part of code in TTS.py and tokenizer_en.py files to fix some errors. You can find it in our repo.

4) add nix parent folder to path
export PYTHONPATH=/home/orangepi/Code/gigi/Resources:$PYTHONPATH
this way the model is loaded into our file.

5) run the verifyTTS
In the Verification folder run the verifyTTS.py 
python verifyTTS.py
